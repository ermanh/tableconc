SUB TERRA	PASTORAL	METRIC FIGURE	WOMAN WALKING	GULLS	APPEAL	IN HARBOR	SMELL!
Where shall I find you,	When I was younger	There is a bird in the poplars!	An oblique cloud of purple smoke	My townspeople, beyond in the great world,	You who are so mighty,	Surely there, among the great docks, is peace, my mind;	Oh strong ridged and deeply hollowed

to make up my band?	Older now	swimming in the river.	a little village—	These whirr about me calling, calling!	I lay among the half burned sticks	and snuggle in among the great ships talking so quietly.	always indiscriminate, always unashamed,
None, not one	I walk back streets	The bird skims above them,	that ends in a saw edge	and for my own part I answer them, loud as I can,	at the edge of the fire.	Maybe you will even fall asleep near them and be	and now it is the souring flowers of the bedraggled

Where are you this day,	the yards cluttered	the great gleam among the poplars!	a dark crimson corner of roof.	First I say this: you have seen	Give me one little flame,	And God knows it matters little for we cannot understand them.	to that rank odor of a passing spring-time!
you my seven year locusts	with old chicken wire, ashes,	It is his singing	To the left, half a tree:	the strange birds, have you not, that sometimes	one!	Yet it is certainly of the sea, of that there can be no question.	Can you not be decent? Can you not reserve your ardors

Ah my beauties how I long—!	the fences and outhouses	of leaves clashing in the wind.	to see you in the street again,	Let them cause you to think well then of the storms	protectingly about the wrist	The smell of them will put us to sleep presently.	for us, do you think, if we continue in these ways?
That harvest	built of barrel-staves		powerful woman,	that drive many to shelter. These things	of him that flung me here,	Smell! It is the sea water mingling here into the river—	Must you taste everything? Must you know everything?
that shall be your advent—	and parts of boxes, all,		coming with swinging haunches,	do not happen without reason.	here upon the very center!	at least so it seems—perhaps it is something else—but what matter?	Must you have a part in everything?
thrusting up through the grass,	if I am fortunate,		breasts straight forward,	And the next thing I say is this:	This is my song.	The sea water! It is quiet and smooth here!	
up under the weeds	smeared a bluish green		supple shoulders, full arms	I saw an eagle once circling against the clouds		How slowly they move, little by little trying

The light shall leap and snap	of all colors.		I might well see you oftener!	three gulls came from above the river			
that day as with a million lashes!	No one		And for a different reason{18}	and crossed slowly seaward!			
Oh, I have you; yes	will believe this		than the fresh eggs	Oh, I know you have your own hymns, I have heard them—

but they shut you out still,			kind grey eyes and a kind mouth;	You see, it is not necessary for us to leap at each other,			
there in the half light.{14}			you walking out toward me	and, as I told you, in the end			
For the simple truth is			from that dead hillside!	the gulls moved seaward very quietly.			
that though I see you clear enough			I might well see you oftener.				
you are not there!							
It is not that—it is you,							
you I want!							
—God, if I could fathom							
the guts of shadows!							
You to come with me							
poking into negro houses							
with their gloom and smell!							
In among children							
leaping around a dead dog!							
Mimicking							
onto the lawns of the rich!							
You!							
to go with me a-tip-toe,							
head down under heaven,							
nostrils lipping the wind!
